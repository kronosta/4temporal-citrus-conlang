Stuff about ⊁まも▣こ⊄, my weird 4x4 table-based conlang with 4 dimensions of time and 4 pronunciations for every syllable.

# Conlang description
This is a very messy and disorganized conlang I mostly developed in a day. I did one before this but it really wasn't a conlang, more like a version of English with 3 stacks in a LIFO grammar like Fith's. Anyway, this conlang is a perfect example of what happens when programmers try to write a language that's not a programming language. It's written in MediaWiki markup because I plan to post this to the Conlang Fandom wiki, though I might have to modify it to fit into the perscribed structure there. Anyway, enjoy this preformatted block!
