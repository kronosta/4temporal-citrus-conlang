# 4temporal-citrus-conlang
Stuff about ⊁まも▣こ⊄, my weird 4x4 table-based conlang with 4 dimensions of time and 4 pronunciations for every syllable.

# Conlang description
This is a very messy and disorganized conlang I mostly developed in a day. I did one before this but it really wasn't a conlang, more like a version of English with 3 stacks in a LIFO grammar like Fith's. Anyway, this conlang is a perfect example of what happens when programmers try to write a language that's not a programming language. It's written in MediaWiki markup because I plan to post this to the Conlang Fandom wiki, though I might have to modify it to fit into the perscribed structure there. Anyway, enjoy this preformatted block!

```
⊁まも▣こ⊄ (pronounced by humans as /ðo/[creaky, nasal] /θo/ /θo/[breathy,
nasal] /tɹaɪz/
/to/[breathy, nasal] /ʃi/[breathy] "break" /myʃ/[sawtooth tone] /mys/[high
tone] /mys/[rising tone]
/tɹaɪz/ /mɛz/[rising tone]  /myʒ/[low tone] "break" /
θl̥ɣm̥ɹym̥ɹvtɹaɪzfwʒðly/) is a language
spoken by citrus trees on Earth.

Some information is necessary for the rest of this article. There are
actually four separate
time dimensions, along with the three spacial ones. Whereas we experience
time in a progressing
point on a timeline, citrus trees experience a 3D surface (twisted into
the remaining dimension),
that expands and flows diagonally throughout their lifetime. We actually
experience all four as
well, just not at the same time. Instead we go through separate straight
lines one by one until
every planck time unit of our lifetimes are filled, since apparently our
lifetimes actually
have "donut holes" in them and consciousness can't handle that. There's
kind of a standard way
the starting timeline is chosen, which is why no one in this timeline
remembers any previous
ones (because we all started on the same Y, Z, and W coordinates).

Some English terminology for the time axes:
{| class="wikitable"
| Past || Present || Future || Axis A
|-
| Krighteng || Troteng || Hotejeng || Axis B
|-
| Dastemme || Desentemme || Duturemme || Axis C
|-
| Tevvelnipe || Gesselnipe || Zuttelnipe || Axis D
|}

Causality happens on all axes at once, and diagonals have a sort of
"compound causality"
which is different. All in all, it's possible for citrus trees to produce
four separate
sounds on different axes. Certain undocumented languages are said to fully
use the sounds
separately, but the one we actually know about just uses a syllabary of
simple
combinations. The sound waves don't work solely in a single linear time
slice, which is
why we can't hear citrus trees speak despite them talking all across our
particular line.
They also walk and have a mostly human-like society, just that Axis A (our
traditional idea
of time) is their designated photosynthesis dimension where they stop
doing anything and
stand in the sun indefinitely on Axis A when the hours on Axes B, C, and D
are all odd,
and the standard starting timeline that this article was written in and
when you're
probably reading it takes place on a photosynthesis hour.

We found out about this language from a series of linguistic notes written
by an anonymous
professor who apparently measured air vibrations in all time slices of a
certain range,
memorized all the measurements, and finally time traveled through the
timeflune to plant
a book on his own desk.

== Structure ==
[language name] utterances (either a turn in a conversation or an ''entire
written work'')
re 4 syllables long on Axes C and D, 8 syllables long on Axis B, and any
number of syllables
long on Axis A. Thus you can write it as a 4x4 table with each entry
having multiple lines.

* Axis A is horizontal within table entries
* Axis B is vertical within table entries
* Axis C is horizontal across the table
* Axis D is vertical across the table

The 4x4 table form can be used to demonstrate the structure on Axes C and
D,
which sorts all meaning into 16 2-part categories.

{| class="wikitable"
| True descriptions of space (where things are, how things are arranged)
| True descriptions of time (events and actions)
| True descriptions of neither space nor time (universal truths)
| Self-referential language that is true and unopinionated (like "I was
being sarcastic")
|-
| Objectively false descriptions of space
| Objectively false descriptions of time
| Objectively false descriptions of neither space nor time (universal lies)
| Self-referential language that is objectively false and unopinionated
(like "I was being sarcastic" when you aren't being sarcastic)
|-
| Opinionated descriptions of space (how the speaker or others feel about
where things are and how things are arranged)
| Objectively false descriptions of time (how the speaker or others feel
events and actions)
| Opinionated descriptions of neither space nor time (like "math is too
hard")
| Self-referential language that is opinionated (like "I really like your
voice")
|-
| False opinionated descriptions of space (the concerned person's opinion
isn't what you say here.
"I hate your outfit" is a joking compliment if you put it here since it's
a roundabout way of
saying "Not bad!" concerning the outfit)
| False opinionated descriptions of time
| False opinionated descriptions of neither space nor time (like "math is
too hard")
| Self-referential language that is false opinionated (like "I really love
it when I randomly stutter")
|}

As you can probably tell, one axis is time/space/universal/self-
referential and the other is
true/false/opinion/false opinion. If you don't know which category to put
it in, the default
is universal-false opinion.

Speakers must sort the content of the utterance into these categories
before saying it or
it's ungrammatical.

As for Axis B, the 8 syllables represent, in order:
# Syllables belonging to a noun
# Syllables belonging to a verb
# Syllables belonging to an adjective
# Syllables belonging to an adverb
# Syllables belonging to an interjection
# Syllables belonging to a preposition
# Syllables belonging to a pronoun
# "The connection"

"The connection" is a description of how all the parts of speech fit
together.
It's a weirdly programming-like system based in prefix notation, with the
following rules:
* Syllables 1-13 represent digits in a base-13 number system
* Syllable 14 starts and ends a number, digits in between
* Syllable 15 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth noun
* Syllable 16 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth verb
* Syllable 17 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth
adjective
* Syllable 18 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth
adverb
* Syllable 19 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth
interjection
* Syllable 20 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth
preposition
* Syllable 21 should be followed by a number n, and signifies the nth
pronoun
* Syllable 22 takes two phrases and establishes a relation between them,
: by the following rules depending on their overall part of speech ("car"
and "the man in the car"
: are both nouns under these rules). Pronouns are considered nouns even
though they
: have a separate Axis B syllable index.
** Noun-verb : The noun is the subject of the verb. This produces a verb.
** Verb-noun : The noun is the object of the verb. This produces a verb.
*: You can chain these together for multiple objects ("I gave the book to
the kids").
*: This and the previous are also sort of similar to sentences at the top
level.
** Adjective-noun : The adjective modifies the noun. This produces a noun.
** Adjective-adjective : Both adjectives apply. This produces an adjective.
** Adverb-verb : The adverb modifies the verb. This produces a verb.
** Adverb-adjective : The adverb modifies the adjective.
** Adverb-adverb : Both adverbs apply. This produces an adverb.
** Preposition-noun : The preposition takes the noun as an argument
("toward the fields"). This produces a preposition
** Noun-preposition : The preposition applies to the noun. This produces a
noun
** Verb-preposition : The preposition applies to the verb. This produces a
verb.
** Interjection-anything : The interjection is because of the other thing.
This produces an interjection.
* Syllable 23 - End of connection, the remaining syllables are meaningless
* Syllable 24 - Unused
* Syllable 25 - Takes two phrases of the same type, establishes an "and"
relation between them
* Syllable 26 - Takes two phrases of the same type, establishes an "or"
relation between them
* Syllable 27 - Takes two phrases of the same type, establishes a "but"
relation between them
* Syllable 28 - Takes two phrases of the same type, establishes an "or"
relation between them,
: but it's the exclusive "or" where both can't apply at the same time
* Syllable 29 - Takes a phrase and a number, maps the phrase to the number
to use multiple times, also returns back the phrase so you can still use it
* Syllable 30 - Takes a number, gets the phrase remembered using the
previous
* Syllable 31 - Takes two syllables from 1-4, a syllable from 1-8, and a
number, indexes Axes C and D in that order with the first two syllable
indices, indexes Axis B with the third syllable index, and takes the nth
word of that part of speech of that entry in the table, or the phrase
mapped to the number if Axis B was indexed with 8. This can be used to
have the equivalent of something in English having both a truth and a lie
in the same sentence, or both a fact and an opinion, or a whole multitude
of other important things.
* Syllable 32 - Takes another syllable and two phrase arguments a and b,
*: establishes a different logical relation between phrases:
** Syllable 1 - a NAND b
** Syllable 2 - a NOR b
** Syllable 3 - a NXOR b
** Syllable 4 - a IMPLIES b
** Syllable 5 - NOT (a IMPLIES b)
** Regular old negation can be done with a XOR 1 or various other
**: constructs. One interesting detail is that the 1st person singular
**: pronoun んここ▣むみな⊋ is a grammatical substitute for an entire
**: objectively true phrase.


It's possible for the connection to contain multiple trees. If this is
the case, only the last one is treated as the sentence. However,
you can represent multiple sentences by combining them with "and" clauses
with Syllable 25. This also means it's possible to "hide" grammatical
phrases by not including them in anything, but these will still be
interpreted by the listener, usually indicating hesitation to say
it.

If the same phrase is referenced twice by these trees, it's treated like
the same object. So when saying "I just bought a large box of candy. I
would prefer if you didn't eat any of my candy." (bad example, maybe, but
I'll roll with it), the first sentence would qualify as a true description
of space and a true description of time, and the second sentence would
qualify as an opinion. "The event of me buying a large box of candy was
recent", "There is a large box of candy in the living room", "I would
prefer if you didn't eat my candy". Instead of rebuilding "large box of
candy" from scratch each time, you can use a cross-reference with Syllable
31 to refer to the exact same object multiple times. Speakers are
generally '''expected''' to optimize this way, and if they don't it sounds
like they mean a different object of the same type each time (i.e. There
are three boxes of candy mentioned in the conversation. Box #1 was bought
recently but could have been completely consumed even more recently. Box
#2 is in the living room. Box #3 you don't want the listener to eat, but
Box #1 (if it exists) and Box #2 may or may not be okay with the speaker
to eat).

If a phrase represents a whole sentence, you can use it to talk about the
sentence itself.

A few other rules:
* Syllable 23 marks the end of "the connection" or one of the word lists.
: You can put anything after that and it's grammatically junk.
: It seems the only reason they do this instead of just putting a ton of
23's is for aesthetics.
* Syllable 24 separates words in the word list
* You can convert words noun->adjective, adjective->adverb, verb->noun
(one who does the action),
: verb->adjective (pertaining to doing the action) by putting them in the
wrong row. You can also
: use time-partition nouns such as "Future" or "Dastemme" in the
preposition category to mean in
: that direction of time. You can do this for other pairs too, just that
the meaning isn't as set.
* All rows in Axis A must be the same length, ensuring that the utterance
is perceivable in one
: consistent rectangular prism prism.
* You are grammatically required to put something in all 16 table entries,
and it can't just be
: a row of empty meanings ended by 23. Usually native speakers are always
able to find something
: to put in the entries that relates to the conversation, but you can
always just put "1+1=2"
: in the universal truths box for example. 
* When writing in 4x4 table form, the following system is used to choose
the script:
:{| class="wikitable"
| Katakana || Katakana || Katakana || Katakana
|-
| Katakana || Hiragana || Hiragana || Katakana
|-
| Katakana || Hiragana || Hiragana || Katakana
|-
| Katakana || Katakana || Katakana || Katakana
|}

== Phonotactic'''s''' ==
The language has four separate pronunciations per syllable, and Axis A
changes its
timbre extremely depending on emotion. The pronunciations follow a more
logical order
going CDBA rather than ABCD though, so we'll document them in that order.

=== Axis C "The Guttural Discrete" ===
The 61 syllables are divided into 60 main syllables composed of one of 12
consonants and
one of 5 "vowels", and one misfit syllable.

The 12 consonants:
* /vw/
* /fw/
* /dl/
* /tl/
* /mɹ/
* /mɹ̥/
* /m̥ɹ/
* /m̥ɹ̥/
* /θl/
* /θl̥/
* /ðl/
* /ðl̥/

The 5 "vowels":
* /y/
* /x/
* /ɣ/
* /v/
* /ʒ/

The misfit syllable:
* /tɹaɪz/

=== Axis D "The Tonal" ===
The 61 syllables are divided into 10 syllables in 6 tones, with one misfit syllable.

The syllables:
* /mɛs/
* /mɛz/
* /mɛʃ/
* /mɛʒ/
* /mɛð/
* /mys/
* /myz/
* /myʃ/
* /myʒ/
* /myð/

The tones:
* High
* Medium
* Low
* Rising
* Falling
* Sawtooth (rise from low to high, then quickly drop down back to low and
repeat)

The misfit syllable:
* /tɹaɪz/

=== Axis B "The Timbral" ===
The 61 syllables are divided into 2 vowels, /i/ and /o/,
modal/breathy/creaky voice, modal/nasal voice,
and 6 consonants, /t/, /d/, /θ/, /ð/, /ʃ/, plus the usual /tɹaɪz/ misfit
syllable.

=== Axis A "The Musical" ===
This is the most unique one, and the one that expresses emotions. It's
based on 2 octaves of the
31-EDO musical scale (dividing the octave into 31 notes), with two
octaves. The syllable numbering
was based on lowest pitch to highest pitch. The octaves are usually
octaves 2 and 3 (apart from
the lowest G sharp, A flat, and A half flat), but since language is
already intelligible with
the three other pronunciations, and this is their most expressive voice,
there's a large amount
of room for creativity here. Often times speakers will just jam out
whatever in this voice in
all but the most formal situations. Chords are even possible in this voice
since this voice is
more like a direct manipulation of outwardly traveling sound waves rather
than indirectly
controlling with the vocal tract.

Humans have signals for 7 basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, afraid,
disgusted, surprised, contemptful).
Citrus trees also have these, but they're only signaled via the timbre of
this voice.

* Neutrality sounds plucked, and by voice varies from bass guitar to
harpsichord.
* Happiness sounds pressed or keyed, and by voice varies from piano to all
sorts
: of crazy synth sounds with a similar pressed/keyed sound.
* Sadness sounds bowed, and varies through all sorts of string instrument
sounds.
* Anger varies through different kinds of woodwinds and flutes (this is
strange to
: a lot of humans since these instruments typically are associated with
calmer emotions)

The previous four have their base note as the nearest 31-EDO note below a
standard tuning G# at 440 hz
base tuning (which is similar to the G# typical to Western music but
slightly flat). Fear, disgust,
surprise, and contempt are much, much weirder and more specific. The most
accurate descriptor would
of course be a recording of an actual speaker, but we don't have that
currently, so these
reconstructions will have to do:
<!-- upload audio files and link them -->
* Fear: [https://github.com/kronosta/4temporal-citrus-conlang/blob/main/Expression%20Fear.mp3]
* Disgust: [https://github.com/kronosta/4temporal-citrus-conlang/blob/main/Expression%20Disgust.mp3]
* Surprise: [https://github.com/kronosta/4temporal-citrus-conlang/blob/main/Expression%20Surprise.mp3]
* Contempt: [https://github.com/kronosta/4temporal-citrus-conlang/blob/main/Expression%20Contempt.mp3]

== Syllabary ==
The symbol choice is mostly human. Citrus trees do have a two-script 61-
syllable writing system but
the symbols aren't in Unicode. However, to fulfill the aesthetic of the
true writing system,
Japanese's basic Hiragana and Katakana syllables are used for the first 46
syllables, mathematical
Unicode operators are used to fill the rest of Hiragana, and APL symbols
are used to fill Katakana.
The 61st symbol, being special in its pronunciation, gets its characters
from the Geometric Shapes Unicode block/

Oh yeah and I'm not going to shift all these hard to type characters
backward after I found out
I made mistakes while typing the Hiragana, so uhh, we'll chalk it up to
the weirdness of the
norm that "mu" comes after all the otherwise Unicode-ordered Japanese
characters and we have
the odd "vu" symbol (I couldn't figure out the other one I missed but I
knew there were supposed
to be 46 characters and I had 44).

== Lexicon ==
There are three sources of words:
* The standard lexicon, located at [https://github.com/kronosta/4temporal-
citrus-conlang/blob/main/Lexicon%20Generator/words-generated.tsv]
* Numbers, starting and ending with せ with base 13 digits of syllables 1-
13 in between representing digits 0-C.
* Foreign words/concepts can be represented in a rather complicated way.
: It must start with syllable 61, then syllables 1-16 should represent
hexadecimal digits 0-F further on,
: grouped in pairs to form the bytes of a UTF-8 encoded string to run
through a Perl interpreter via eval.
: "use utf8" and "use feature 'unicode_strings'" are considered to be
already run It must produce a list
: reference with two elements:
:* Index 0: Either the native name of the language, or another list
reference of the same form
:: unambiguously referring to the language
:* Index 1: A string in the language
:* Index 2 (Usually optional, but sometimes required for encoding
languages with no canonical
:: text form): Another list reference of the same form, detailing how to
decode into the proper language.

== Speaking in linear time ==
Since humanity doesn't have 4 dimensions of time to work with, some might
come to the conclusion that
we cannot ever speak, hear, or experience this language. They're kinda
right, but we can approximate
it by linearizing it.

Linearizing ⊁まも▣こ⊄ is essentially the following process:
* Turn Axis A into music in some way (could be a real microtonally-capable
instrument or some kind
: of software), and play syllables as if you were reading a book past to
future, Krighteng to Hotejeng,
: Dastemme to Duturemme, Tevvelnipe to Zuttelnipe.
* Say "break".
* Pronounce syllables of Axis B in a similar order to Axis A, except this
time Krighteng to Hotejeng

If you're making something like a text-to-speech program, you can always
generate waveforms on the fly
for diagonal or curved timelines. A multiplicative 4-way Cartesian product
thingie on the waveforms
with amplitude measured -1.0 to 1.0 may be of use for having separate
sounds on the four orthagonal time
axes, though sounds will become extremely quiet when they lie close to a
zero value on a different
axis' waveform. This entire paragraph is in English and means something.

== Sample translation ==
I did not make this for the Cursed Conlang Circus 3 (I would have
submitted it if I came up with this idea earlier though), but I have a
good idea of how I would translate the Twilight text, so here's me working
through the process of translation.

Original text: "About three things I was absolutely positive: First,
Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know
how potent that part might be - that thirsted for my blood. And third, I
was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him."

First we have to separate the sentence into parts based on truth, opinion, space, and time. Here's my attempt:

{| class="wikitable"
| ( Edward was a vampire ) [#1]. ( There was ( a part of him ) [#5] that thirsted for my blood ) [#2]. ''(this is a pretty obvious categorization as a true description of space, as descriptions of current objects are inherently descriptions of space (or the characteristics of space))''
| ( First, +#1. Second, +#2. Third, +#3. ) [#4] ''(this is debatable categorization, but I think the protagonist is thinking these thoughts in order, otherwise it would be less organized)''
| ( About three things I was absolutely positive: +#4. ) [#7] I don't know how potent +#5 might be. ''(again debatable, but I think this is more of an objective introspection into thoughts that she is having than an opinion. It is an objectively true fact that she is thinking these three things, and this sentence doesn't project an opinion onto this fact. This also isn't self-referential since it doesn't talk about her use of language)''
| I outlined three organized thoughts in the sentence: +#4 ''(We have to make something up here since no self-referential language exists in this excerpt. I have some better things to say but they should go in the opinion section.)''
|-
| Edward was an xlalarune in disguise. ''(Now for the lies, these are required for the sentence to be grammatically correct, and we can kinda go wild here.)''
| ( In 1776, Julius Caesar was elected president. ) [#6]
| You can link two torispheres together without any spheritori in between.
| [#6] is a compound sentence.
|-
| I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.
| Had I been younger and less overtaken by love, I think I would have run away immediately.
| I generally like to order my thoughts neatly.
| +#7 is ordered a bit unclearly.
|-
| Edward has awful body odor.
| I'm a bit grossed out how long Edward has been alive.
| Maybe I should just give him a little blood. ''(Stretching a bit here to come up with related universal false opinions.)''
| I hate the way I think.
|}

Now to reword this to fit the lexicon and structures closer:

{| class="wikitable"
| ( ( <code>["English", "Edward"]</code> ) [#8] is[past] <code>["English", "vampire"]</code>) [#1]. ( part of him ) [#5] need[past] my body water ) [#2].
| (Thought 1, +#1. Thought 2, +#2. Thought 3, +#3. ) [#4]
| ( I is[past] sure 3 thing: +#4. ) [#7] I know not might[as in strength; it's in the lexicon for the more common definition but there's almost nothing else to use] +#5.
| I cover[past] 3 build[used as adjective "built" to mean "orderly" I guess] thought in sentence: +#4
|-
| +#8 is[past] <code>["English", "centaur"]</code> cover[past] in story. [I unironically love the idea of saying you're "covered in story" instead of "in disguise". Could just be "in story" but that doesn't sound as funny.
| ( Year 1776, <code>["English", "Julius Caesar"]</code> is[past] put on country. ) [#6]
| You can put 2 torisphere together with no spheritorus between.
| [#6] is together sentence.
|-
| I love[past] +#8 with no condition and no allow[as adjective allowed] change.
| Depend[as adjective depending] age and my sense love, I might go.
| I like order[present] my thought clean[as adverb cleanly].
| +#7 is order[past] not clear[as adverb clearly].
|-
| +#8 smell[present] bad.
| I feel bad about +#8[as adjective Edward's] life[as adjective] length.
| I should[adverb (not technically but modifies a verb like an adverb should)] give +#8 body water
| I hate my thought
|}
